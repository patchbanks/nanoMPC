# nanoMPC

This repo contains a modified version of nanoGPT for fast and efficient generative MIDI music. The nanoMPC model employs a simple technique of training a small transformer model with big data, leveraging extensive data augmentation to achieve generalization while maintaining a lightweight architecture. This approach ensures the model is not only powerful and coherent, but also efficient for personalized training.

## Performance and Model Upgrades

The model is capable of learning styles of finger drumming and beat-making with intricate detail, including humanized velocities, rhythm swings, and rudimental patterns. These results are largely made possible through a data normalization process and the use of scaled-augmentation tools, ensuring the model is trained with sufficient examples of nuanced and expressive drum notations. Additionally, the positional encodings and attention mechanism were slightly modified for improved accuracy in the time domain.

## Training for Music Production

Currently, this model is only available through a development program for professional music producers and content creators. This program empowers creators to access the power of AI without the complexities and technical hurdles of training a custom model.
